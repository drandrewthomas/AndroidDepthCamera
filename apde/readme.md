# A depth camera library for APDE and Processing for Android

## Overview

Here you will find the code for the Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth camera library file and an example app for use with the APDE Android app. You should also be able to use it with Processing for Android, although you may need to make some changes. Plus, if you want to use the library file in AIDE or Android Studio, not that you should just need to rename it, from a pde to a java file extension, and use the APDE example to see how to use it. If you want to do that I'll assume you know what you're doing and won't provide any more info on it for now: APDE is an excellent way to code in Processing on an Android device, so this project is aimed at it for the acquisition of depth data.

## Screenshot

Below is a screenshot of the APDE app running in the previewer. Note that if the Android device you use does not have a depth camera you should still see an example loaded from file, albeit without the camera and save buttons.
