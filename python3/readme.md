# Using Depth Camera data in Python 3 and PyDroid3

**Note:** All of the code here was written in Python3 using PyDroid3 on an Android device. So you can use the code on a PC or an Android tablet. However, the point cloud example uses matplotlib with a very large number of 3D vertices, so will update very slowly on most Android devices if you drag to change the plot view.
